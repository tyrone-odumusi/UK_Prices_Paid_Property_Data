This repository contains code, data, and results for an assessment of all registered property sales in England and Wales that are sold for full market value from **1 January 2019** to **31 December 2022**.

The purpose of this project was to create judgements and observations from various houses prices paid datasets by inspecting the progression of residential property price information throughout recent years. This allowed us to identify opportunities in the real estate business for both buyers and sellers of properties in the UK.


This project utilised Microsoft Excel, Python, SQL and Tableau.
